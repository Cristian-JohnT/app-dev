**My favourite series is the kung fu panda series because the trilogy allows me to reflect to myself physically, mentally and spirituaslly**
*The first movie is about Po's physical form, he is a fat panda and he clearly doen't looks like to be fitting to the role of the dragon warrior which he proves wrong later on the series.*
~~Lets just pretend the 4th movie didn't happen~~.
Out of the trilogy I really like the first movie because ***it talks and discuss about the physical form, it explores deeper about it. What you are on the outside does not define you inside***.
I love Kung Fu Panda! :joy:
